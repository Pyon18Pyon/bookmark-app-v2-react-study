# bookmark-app-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaSrcipt Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this couse, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I re-wrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [bookmark-app-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/bookmark-app-v1-javascript-study).

## What it does?

This website allows users to save bookmarks and be able to click on the links to go to those websites.

## Key features

- Click an **ADD BOOKMARK** button to launch into a modal, and users can enter name and web address.
- No need to enter *http* or *https* or even *w-w.*...
- Able to delete an individual item from the list of bookmarks.
- Populates favicons which is done dynamically.
- Has local storage functionality, meaning that a user can come back to the website any time and find the bookmarks just as they left them.
- Mobile responsive
